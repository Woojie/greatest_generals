              I first took up history when I was probably around grade four, while searching the net using the ultra-fast dial up modem, I ran into Edward Gibbon's "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire”. My parents caved and let me print some 250 pages of the book so that I could read it, and I never went back. I would like to believe that that was the first time I've taken up interested in history, but being Korean, I was privy to historical stories. Yi Sun Shin, King Sejong, and most notably, the Three Kingdoms of China are some examples.

          I remember virtually nothing of Edward Gibbon's book, except for the fact that it was what sparked my interest in history. It's weird to put such emphasis on a book that I hardly remember, but I still believe it is important because it made me rethink how I should read history; as something that happened years ago, rather than just stories. I went back to my favorite 'story', the Three Kingdoms, and read it in a much more careful manner. I was so embroiled in the stories of the Three Kingdoms that I could recite the stories of at least 200 individuals that have lived in that era. I than got back into games about the Three Kingdoms, whether it be Romance of the Three Kingdoms, or Dynasty Warriors. The Three Kingdoms was probably the best time in history for a youngling like myself to engage in; it had intrigue, romance, massive campaigns, heroes, and villains.

          However, being engaged in the Three Kingdoms meant that my interested in history curved a certain way, perhaps for the worst. The Romance of the Three Kingdoms was in its entirety, a book about politics and war, with an emphasis on war. From here on to my first year in university, I must have read about a hundred books on history, and God knows how many online articles online, but my focus was entirely on military history. I could recite the tactics used by Hannibal at Cannae, Trebbia, and Lake Traismene, or Shaka's formations seemingly replicative of ancient great generals, but I could not tell you about Carthaginian culture or Zulu culture. I could tell you about the political discourse that led to the Thirty Years' War or World War II, but nothing about what happened during peacetime or what cultural development occurred. I was completely infatuated with military history, and I was ok with it. Of course, I respected other forms of history; I did, for a part of my teenage years, work at a museum where most of what I learned was cultural history. It had just never occurred to me how little military history was, or what little significance it probably held in the course of human history compared to, say cultural history or the history development of the modern state. It wasn't until university that I realized that, it was perhaps the development of the modern state in France that led to a huge rise in manpower, and not the other way around as Geoffrey Parker suggested; or that perhaps stirrups did not play an important role in the development of feudal states as I had learned from books.

          Not only did I realize how little I actually knew of history, but I realized in university that the narrative of history is not as linear as I had once thought. One of my favorite things about university when it came to academics was that it opened me to a source that I have never had prior, and that was journal articles from academics. Unlike books, whose intentions were to clearly sell books to a wider audience, academic articles were specific, 10-40page articles that carefully studied a specific viewpoint in history. What is more, the writers of these articles, experts in their fields, had researched these articles/dissertations immensely and felt very personal about their work. Professors at the university felt very protective of their work, and they argued against other experts on various fine points in their articles. Reading these debates about a certain topic, say the influence of radar in the War of the Pacific, with so much evidence and professionalism astounded me. I argued and debated with people on forums about things, but in the fashion that they were, with dozens of sourced articles all leading back to the most primary source possible in any language available.

          So why am I writing about military history and not about other perspectives of the study of history? Well, that's because, honestly, I don’t care how little military had impacted history, to me, it I the most entertaining and fun aspect (maybe I'm disturbed, who knows). Even if it’s a tiny part of history, it is still so large that no one man can possibly comprehend all of it. There are so many interesting aspects and debates one can have about military history, and in a society filled with using violence as a medium of entertainment, undoubtedly a popular one. I don't consider myself an expert on history, but I do believe I have a general understanding of recorded military history in most parts of the world.

          And thus, with no real expertise except hours wasted reading journal articles and books, I write this book. Despite what I wrote about professionalism in university literature, most of the writing here will be written very casually. This is because its much easier, I am not an expert, and more importantly, I believe more casual writings peak people's interests more than academic writing. Though I certainly had fun reading and writing academic essays, writing in a much more casual manner also appeals to me more. I will briefly explain military history across the world, followed by what traits make a good general. The major portion of the book will be about whom I believe are the one hundred greatest military commanders in human history.

          The list that I had made date back to high school for a website that I had created (a forum where people debated about the various aspects of history). Since then, the list has been significantly revised to add more people from different times. Even as I am writing this I question several of the selections I have made and switch them around from time to time, but I believe, for the most part, I have the list down to what I believe to be the list. And surely when I finish writing this I will have doubts about some of the choices I have made. After all, even though I believe I thoroughly searched through history across every continent, more stories of military brilliance will pop up that I will be interested in perhaps adding to this list, or I will learn more about a specific commander that makes me change my mind. Regardless I will stick to this list for now without regrets (well maybe a little bit of regret).
